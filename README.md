- 👋 Hi, I’m @JRyanB (José Ryan). I'm from Brazil, i'm currently 19 years old and i'm a computer engeneering student. 
- 👀 I’m interested in improving my knowledge about programming and contributing as much as i can with other peoples work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, but when it comes to programming languages, the one i would like to learn more about is python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in simple projects, since i'm still a begginer i'm trying to help and learn at the same time, and i feel like i can achieve that easier by starting with simple things.
- 📫 If you are interested in contacting me, my email is joseryan003@gmail.com.
